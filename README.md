# documentation-samples

Hi! I'm Harshit Soni üëã  

This repository includes a few sample documentation write-ups I've prepared to showcase my technical writing approach and style.  
They cover examples of user guides, product documentation, and structured content for AI/ML-based platforms.

For personal write-ups, I usually use tools like **Google Docs**, **Notion**, **Paint**, **Snipping Tool**, and **Grammarly** for drafting, reviewing, and creating screenshots.  
In a professional setting, I use **VS Code**, **Markdown**, **Git**, **JIRA**, and **Docusaurus** in addition to the above tools.

### üß≠ Documentation Workflow

When creating documentation, I follow a structured approach:

1. **Identify** the user persona and the use case.  
2. **Research** the product or feature by reviewing existing documentation and/or speaking with subject matter experts (SMEs).  
3. **Create** an outline, then write and format the content.  
4. **Review** iteratively with stakeholders and finalize.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Work Methodology

In the workplace, I follow the **Agile methodology**, which involves:
- Working in sprints.  
- Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams.  
- Updating documentation continuously alongside development.

I also follow the **Documentation Development Life Cycle (DDLC)**, which includes:
- **Planning**  
- **Drafting**  
- **Reviewing**  
- **Publishing**  
- **Maintaining** documentation in sync with the product lifecycle.


Thanks for checking them out!
